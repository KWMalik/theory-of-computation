Theory of Computation -- or -- Computability Theory
===================================================

Background
----------
This study of this material stands at the intersection of three fields:

1. mathematics
2. theoretical computer science
3. philosophy

In terms of mathematics
-----------------------
Mathematically, computability theory originates from the concept of an *algorithm*.
It leads to a classification of functions according to their inherent *complexity*.

In terms of computer science
----------------------------
For the computer scientist, computability theory shows that quite apart from practical matters of running time
and memory space, there is a purely theoretical limit to what computer programs can do.
This is an important fact, and leads to the questions:

* Where is the limit?
* What is on this side of the limit?
* What lies beyond it?

In terms of philosophy
----------------------
Computability is relevant to the philosophy of mathematics and, in particular, to the questions:

* What *is* a proof?
* Does every true sentence have a proof?
* What is infinity?
* What is computable, and similarly, what is unsolvable?
